# Iris Classification Project

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify the species of the Iris flower into three categories: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** based on their features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).

## 📂 Project Structure

- `data/` — Folder containing the Iris dataset (if any local file used).
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts for data analysis and modeling.
- `models/` — Saved trained models (optional).
- `README.md` — Project documentation (this file).

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the famous **Iris dataset**, originally introduced by **Ronald A. Fisher** in 1936.  
It contains 150 samples, with 4 features each:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width  
and a target variable:
- Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (for model building)
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. Load the dataset
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Preprocess the data (if needed)
4. Split the data into training and testing sets
5. Train different classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN)
6. Evaluate models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
7. Select the best-performing model

## 📈 Results

The model achieved a high accuracy in classifying the Iris flowers.  
*(You can add your final accuracy here, e.g., "Final Accuracy: 97% on test data.")*

## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook iris_classification.ipynb
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    python iris_classification.py
    ```

## ✨ Future Work

- Deploy the model as a web application using Streamlit or Flask.
- Experiment with advanced models like Random Forest, SVM, or XGBoost.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve performance further.
